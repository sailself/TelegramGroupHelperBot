# Multi-Model AI Integration with Interactive Selection

## Core Changes

### Interactive Model Selection Interface (bot/handlers.py)

1. **Model Selection Buttons**:
   - Implemented interactive inline keyboard with 4 AI model options
   - Added smart filtering to show only media-capable models when media is present
   - Created callback handler for button interactions with user validation
   - Added configurable timeout system (30 seconds default) with automatic cleanup

2. **Enhanced Q Handler**:
   - Modified `/q` command to show model selection interface when OpenRouter is available
   - Added fallback to Gemini-only mode when OpenRouter is disabled/unavailable
   - Implemented request context storage for processing after model selection
   - Added proactive message cleanup every 5 seconds to remove expired selections

3. **Model-Specific Commands**:
   - Restored `/deepseek`, `/qwen`, `/llama`, and `/gpt` commands to work with specific models
   - Each command bypasses selection interface and processes directly with chosen model
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing command structure

### Configuration Enhancements (bot/config.py)

1. **New OpenRouter Settings**:
   - Added `ENABLE_OPENROUTER` toggle for enabling/disabling multi-model selection
   - Added `MODEL_SELECTION_TIMEOUT` for configurable selection timeout (default: 30 seconds)
   - Enhanced OpenRouter model configuration with proper fallback handling

2. **Smart Fallback Logic**:
   - Automatic detection of OpenRouter availability (API key + enabled flag)
   - Graceful degradation to Gemini-only mode when OpenRouter is unavailable
   - Cost control through configurable OpenRouter disable option

### Proactive Cleanup System (bot/main.py, bot/handlers.py)

1. **Background Cleanup Task**:
   - Implemented periodic cleanup task running every 5 seconds
   - Automatic deletion of expired model selection messages from Telegram
   - Memory cleanup of expired request contexts
   - Graceful task lifecycle management (start/stop with bot)

2. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Fun timeout messages with emojis ("turned into a pumpkin 🎃", "cookie stealing 🍪")
   - Clean chat history with automatic message removal
   - User-specific button access (prevents hijacking)
   - Responsive interface with immediate feedback

### Technical Improvements

1. **Callback Query Handling**:
   - Comprehensive callback data validation and parsing
   - User authorization checks for button interactions
   - Timeout validation with automatic cleanup
   - Error handling for edge cases (deleted messages, network issues)

2. **Request Context Management**:
   - Efficient storage and retrieval of pending requests
   - Complete context preservation (media, text, user info, timestamps)
   - Memory-efficient cleanup of expired contexts
   - Thread-safe operations for concurrent requests

## Migration Requirements

Users should:

1. **Optional Configuration Updates**:
   - Add `ENABLE_OPENROUTER=true/false` to control model selection interface
   - Add `MODEL_SELECTION_TIMEOUT=30` to customize selection timeout
   - Configure OpenRouter API key and model identifiers for multi-model support

2. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - All existing commands continue to work unchanged
   - Default behavior maintains model selection (when OpenRouter is configured)
   - Graceful fallback ensures functionality even without OpenRouter setup

3. **No Breaking Changes**:
   - Existing `/q` usage works with new interface
   - Model-specific commands restored to original functionality
   - Database schema unchanged - no migrations required

## Performance and Reliability

The multi-model integration provides:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: Interactive model selection with visual feedback and automatic cleanup
2. **Improved Performance**: Background cleanup prevents memory leaks and chat clutter
3. **Cost Control**: Configurable OpenRouter integration allows cost management
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful fallbacks
5. **Scalability**: Efficient request management and cleanup systems
